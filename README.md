# The Face of a True Hacker: Diving deep into Social Engineering

Hey! Recently I have been learning many eye opening aspects concerning the power of behavior and motivation when it comes to cybersecurity. Many minds can easily go to the effects and repercussions a malicious payload can have on a system and its networks when thinking of what is hot right now in cyber. But sometimes what can be overlooked is how that malware initially arrived on that machine in the first place. This is a crucial step that can help cyber practitioners and end users create then sustain a better security posture to better help keep threat actors at bay. 

Some people may be surprised on what a threat actor can actually look like, sound like, or be capable of in terms of behavior. Not all hackers exemplify the stereotype of being antisocial while sitting in their mother's basement with a black hoodie on all night. While that may happen in some instances, threat actors who are successful at what they do understand the value that persuasion and manipulation has on a malicious operation. Results are made for them when they are able to be out and about in the world, making connections and building trust with people who can possibly be used to exploit a physical vulnerability. 

Additionally, social engineering is leveraged by the bad guys to manipulate users and unsuspecting victims to release any sensitive information by playing on certain behavioral triggers. These can be known as responding to a figure or organization in authority, having a sense of urgency behind a request, using social proof as a means of authentication or validation, likability, and even fear. As stated earlier, these are all powerful things that can even make some of the most experienced security practitioners seem like a complete rookie in the realm of common sense. 

As a result, your threat actor could look like a UPS driver, social media influencer, a kind old man, or simply a beautiful woman. Looks can be deceiving and at the bottom line, this should not be a factor that is relied upon when trying to authenticate and allow unknown personnel access to any kind of sensitive information or area of an organization. 

In addition to these concepts, my studies for this section also comprised topics such as: 

- Impersonation methods
- Pretexting
- Phishing Attacks
- Anti-Phishing Campaigns
- Frauds and Scams
- Influence Campaigns
- Various Social Engineering Attacks
